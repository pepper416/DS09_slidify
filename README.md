DS09_slidify
============
I just realized the link that I provided in the Coursera Course Project submission page is invalid. I don't know why...

One solution is :
you can copy my [.Rmd file](https://github.com/pepper416/DS09_slidify/blob/master/index.Rmd) to [http://slidify.github.io/playground/](http://slidify.github.io/playground/) then click submit. My presentation will be showed to the right.

I have tried really hard to publish the .html file to the Rpubs or Github...However, it doesn't work. I have spended more than 10 hours on it!!! Please help me.
